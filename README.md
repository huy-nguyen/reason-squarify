# reason-squarify

This is an implementation of the squarified tree map algorithm in ReasonML.
Do check out the two-part series of articles ([part one](https://www.huy.dev/squarified-tree-map-reasonml-part-1-2019-03/) and [part two](https://www.huy.dev/squarified-tree-map-reasonml-part-2-2019-05/)) that accompany this code.
I previously implemented a TypeScript version [here](https://github.com/huy-nguyen/squarify).
